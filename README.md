## Introduction

As a part of *Meta's Coursera Database Engineering Course*, this is the capstone project. The project is expected to span 4 weeks. <br/>
The project includes:
1. Week 1
    1. Setup the database and *MySQL* server. _Downloaded_ via *brew*.
    2. Create and implement and Entity Relationship (*ER*) diagram.
        1. Ensure that ER diagram conforms to 3NF. - This helps in avoiding the *insertion, update and delete* anamolies.
        2. Use *MySQL Workbench* for the diagram and generate *sql query* using *Forward Engineering*. MySQL Workbench is a visual tool for database modelling and data management. Via Forward Engineering MySQL Workbench allows us to transform the data model into a physical database schema.
    3. Setting up *Git* for version control and setting up *GitHub/Git* for project management and publication.

Through this document, I expect to track my progress in the project.

## Release Notes

#### Week Overview

Need to set up a booking system to keep track of which guests are visiting the restaurant and at what times.<br/>
In this first stage of the task, you need to:

- Set up a repository, or local directory to house your code.
- Record all changes made within the system as theyâ€™re implemented.
- And allow others to view, review and add to your code.


#### Implementation

1. Installed the requirements:
    1. *MySQL* server: _Downloaded_ via *brew*.
